# Pomodoro Timer

A simple Pomodoro Timer application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What's New?

I've just completed an exciting JavaScript project that implements the Pomodoro Technique! The project helps manage time effectively by breaking work into intervals with breaks in between. This simple yet powerful method boosts productivity and prevents burnout.
