# Pomodoro Timer

A simple Pomodoro Timer application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What's New?

I've just completed an exciting JavaScript project that implements the Pomodoro Technique! The project helps manage time effectively by breaking work into intervals with breaks in between. This simple yet powerful method boosts productivity and prevents burnout.

## Project Details

**Description**: The Pomodoro App is designed to help you focus on one specific task for 25-minute intervals (pomodoros), followed by a short break of 5-10 minutes. After four pomodoros, you take a longer break.

**Code Implementation**: The project is structured with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to create a functional and visually appealing Pomodoro timer.

## Features

- Start and reset the timer
- Circular design around the timer and buttons
- Hover effects on buttons
- Short breaks of 5 minutes after each pomodoro
- Long breaks of 15 minutes after every four pomodoros
